What is Node.js :-
------------------
-> Node.js is an open source server environment
-> Node.js is free
-> Node.js runs on varoius platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS)

Why Node.js :-
----------------
Node.js uses asynchrnous programming.
Here is how Node.js hadles a file request.
-> Send the task to the computers file system.
-> Ready to handle next request.
-> When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting and simply continues with next request.
Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchrnous programming which is very memory efficient.
